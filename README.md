# TunnelScan: A Novel Tunnel Surface Defect Detection Model

## Overview

TunnelScan is a state-of-the-art model designed for detecting surface defects in tunnel structures. The model leverages advanced components such as the C2fGLU layer based on the GLUBottleneck module and includes additional upsampling and concatenation steps. These enhancements allow for superior feature representation and the construction of a robust feature pyramid, enabling the model to effectively capture fine and small-scale features. Furthermore, TunnelScan employs a sophisticated detection head and introduces an additional feature map level for improved accuracy.

## Features

- **C2fGLU Layer**: Based on the GLUBottleneck module, enhances feature extraction.
- **Feature Pyramid**: Incorporates additional upsampling and concatenation steps for robust multi-scale feature representation.
- **Advanced Detection Head**: Utilizes a more sophisticated detection head for better precision.
- **Additional Feature Map Level**: Captures fine and small-scale features more effectively.

## The code will be made public after the article is accepted
